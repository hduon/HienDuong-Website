        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside. My major is business administration, with a planned concentration in marketing or finance. I am currently enrolled in a two-year program called Pre-Business in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. I am planning to graduate within four years with the bachelor degree on hand. At the same time, I want to work to have some experience for my future job and money for tuition. 
<br><br>

         At the beginning of this Spring quarter, I applied and got a work-study job on campus. I am an employee at Lothian, one of the two dining halls of the school. There is training online that we have to complete that will help employees know what they are expected to do and how to deal with issues that may arise at work. Some of the topics include food safety, dining services, dining facility safety, allergy training, and the policies and rules. Other than the online training, new employees also have to participate in orientation in person where a student lead shows the employees around the workplace and a brief description of each job. This is only my third week of working but I learned a lot by working at multiple stations. Usually, the supervisor will assign students to work at different stations such as DRO (maintain the cleanliness of the dining hall and refill supplies), clean dishes at the scullery, pot wash, baking, etc. The pros of this system is that employees are exposed to various skills and knowledge. Also, they can earn money while studying. These might not be the specific skills that I need in the future but experience such as how to be responsible, ethical and how to maintain a good relationship with co-worker are definitely essential in every career. The cons are that the dining hall has to spend resources to train new employees, usually at the beginning of the year and the quarter. If students decide to quit because of the schedule, the work environment, the job itself, then the school will be at a disadvantage. 
<br><br>

        Although the jobs appeared as simple and sometimes boring on the surface, they do require a lot of attention and critical thinking. The job itself is very straightforward but there is room for flexibility of how each individual approaches the work. For instance, students who work at the scullery have to clean out the plates, bowls, utensils and cups. The employees themselves can decide how, when and where to put those kitchenwares. Efficiency is also the key when working at the dining hall so the employees also have to pay attention to how their body moves. Working at the dining hall, I am knowledgeable about the tech and the machinesâ€™ functions, the requirements and the expectations of each job, and solutions for relationship issues with co-workers and customers. I want to use these knowledge and skills to continue working at the dining hall for the rest of my college years.
